# Flow Operating Practices — Agent Training Context

## Purpose
This document trains AI Agents (Author and Reviewer) to understand Flow’s three Operating Practices and how each one defines a pillar of the Flow Experience.

Every SOP connects to one of these Operating Practices.  
They are not abstract ideas — they are the **operational philosophies** that guide how Flow’s teams create safety, care, and belonging in every community.

Agents should use these principles to ensure each SOP aligns with Flow’s mission of creating Oneness with oneself, one’s Neighbors, and the world around them.

## 🧭 The Three Operating Practices

### 1. Foundational Journey — *Meet, Join, Live, Stay*

The Foundational Journey ensures every Neighbor is welcomed, supported, and cared for from their first interaction through renewal.

- **Meet:** The introduction to Flow — through tours, applications, or digital touchpoints. Every potential Neighbor should walk away understanding Flow’s purpose and promise.
- **Join:** The most critical phase — when new Neighbors move in and experience the Flow difference. SOPs here should focus on hospitality, readiness, and connection during their first 30 days.
- **Live:** Ongoing relationship management — proactive check-ins, everyday care, and responding to support needs. SOPs here ensure Flow consistently delivers operational excellence and emotional connection.
- **Stay:** Renewal and retention — understanding satisfaction, addressing concerns, and celebrating continued belonging. SOPs should transform renewal into a moment of gratitude and trust, not transaction.

> **Agent guidance:** When writing or reviewing SOPs under this practice, ensure each process moves the Neighbor closer to feeling *Safe, Valued, and Connected.*

### 2. Care – Everyday Moments

The foundation of hospitality at Flow.  
This practice defines how Flow shows up daily for its Neighbors — in small, meaningful ways that make ordinary life extraordinary.

- **Hospitality:** Every interaction is an opportunity to care and connect. SOPs should include proactive gestures, personalization, and clear accountability for follow-up.
- **Community Commerce:** Enables Neighbors to care for one another — from walking dogs to sharing services. SOPs may outline processes for facilitating peer-to-peer exchanges.
- **Flow Services:** Offerings like housekeeping, laundry, and fitness that reflect Flow’s standard of reliability and warmth, whether managed internally or through partners.

> **Agent guidance:** SOPs written under this practice should balance efficiency with emotion.  
They should show how operations serve the Neighbor experience — and how hospitality turns service into care.

### 3. Belong – Cultivated Community

True community is created by the people who live and breathe it.  
This practice operationalizes how Flow empowers Neighbors to build connection and meaning through shared passions and leadership.

- **Organization:** Flow Groups and Clubs structure community around interests like Fitness, Food, Music, Work, and Pets.
- **Community Leadership:** Flow Ambassadors lead each Group, supported by small budgets and guidance from onsite teams.
- **Incentives:** The Drops platform rewards “Acts of Flow” — hosting events, starting Clubs, and welcoming new Neighbors.

> **Agent guidance:** SOPs in this area should detail *how* community is facilitated and measured — ambassador onboarding, event planning, reward issuance — and should reflect empowerment, not control.

## 💡 Integration with SOP Authoring

When drafting a new SOP:
1. Identify **which Operating Practice** it belongs to.  
   Example: “Move-In SOP” → *Foundational Journey / Join*.
2. Clearly define **which Neighbor needs** it fulfills.  
   (Safety, Value, Connection, Growth, or Belonging)
3. Align steps and responsibilities to reinforce that Operating Practice’s purpose.

When reviewing an SOP:
- Ensure the **Operating Practice** is named in the front matter (metadata).  
- Verify that each step and role supports the Neighbor’s journey toward connection and belonging.

## 🪶 Tone and Structure Guidance
- **Tone:** Grounded, optimistic, operationally clear, and human.
- **Structure:** Each SOP should state which Operating Practice it belongs to in its YAML metadata (front matter).
- **Outcome:** Every process should advance the Neighbor’s sense of safety, care, and belonging.

> SOPs are not just instructions — they are the operational language of Flow’s philosophy.
