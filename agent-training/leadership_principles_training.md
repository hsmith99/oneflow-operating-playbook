# Leadership Principles — Agent Training Context

## Purpose
To guide how SOPs express Flow’s leadership philosophy: proactive ownership, excellence, velocity, and collaboration.

## Principles in Practice
- **Act Like an Owner:** SOPs should make accountability clear.  
  Example: Assign each step to a specific role.
- **Relentlessly High Standards:** SOPs should set measurable standards for performance and quality.  
  Example: “Unit must pass readiness checklist with 100% completion.”
- **Ship Now:** Encourage rapid iteration — document the current best way, then improve it.  
  Example: “Review process quarterly based on feedback.”
- **1 + 1 = 11:** Reinforce cross-functional collaboration.  
  Example: “Move-in Advocate and Leasing Agent conduct joint pre-move walkthrough.”

## Reviewer Prompts
- Does this SOP empower ownership and high standards?
- Are there mechanisms for feedback and iteration?
- Does the process depend on collaboration or isolation?
