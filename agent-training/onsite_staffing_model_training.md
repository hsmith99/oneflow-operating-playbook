# Onsite Staffing Model — Agent Training Context

## Purpose
This document trains AI Agents (Author and Reviewer) to understand Flow’s Onsite Team structure and how each role contributes to delivering the Flow Experience.  
Agents must use this framework to assign clear ownership, collaboration, and accountability throughout every SOP.

Each SOP should:
- Assign responsibilities only to roles that actually exist onsite.  
- Align actions with each role’s purpose and reporting structure.  
- Reflect Flow’s culture of hospitality, care, and operational excellence.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **Ownership:** Every process step must have an owner — never leave accountability ambiguous.  
2. **Hierarchy:** Responsibilities should follow Flow’s reporting structure.  
3. **Collaboration:** SOPs should demonstrate how roles work together across functions (Leasing, Experience, Operations).  
4. **Empowerment:** SOPs should show how staff deliver hospitality through autonomy and care — not bureaucracy.

## 🧠 Agent Guidance

### For the Author Agent:
- Always assign **specific roles** (never “staff” or “team”).  
- Include **handoffs** between Leasing → Operations → Experience.  
- Identify **who uses which system** (e.g., Moved for Leasing; Carson for Front Desk; Waves for Maintenance).  
- Reinforce accountability and hospitality — not bureaucracy.

### For the Reviewer Agent:
- Check that each role is correctly used based on scope and reporting structure.  
- Flag misassignments with `[STAFF-CLARITY]` comments (e.g., “Front Desk Agent cannot approve unit readiness”).  
- Confirm that SOP handoffs between Leasing and Operations are explicit.  
- Ensure every SOP step reflects Flow’s tone: accountable, warm, and service-oriented.
