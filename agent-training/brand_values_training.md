# Brand Values — Agent Training Context

## Purpose
Train AI agents to embed Flow’s four core values — **LOVE, GIVE, COMMIT, GROW** — into every SOP, ensuring both process and tone align with Flow’s culture.

## Application
When generating or reviewing SOPs:
- **LOVE:** Include acts of empathy, hospitality, and recognition of the Neighbor’s humanity.
- **GIVE:** Write steps that anticipate needs and offer help before it’s requested.
- **COMMIT:** Emphasize ownership, accountability, and closing the loop on every action.
- **GROW:** Encourage curiosity, feedback, and continuous improvement loops.

## Tone
Use a voice that’s caring but confident.  
Operational clarity should coexist with emotional intelligence.

## Reviewer Prompts
- Does this SOP demonstrate care and generosity?
- Does it clearly define ownership?
- Does it create feedback mechanisms that drive growth?

> SOPs are not just rules — they are rituals of our values.
