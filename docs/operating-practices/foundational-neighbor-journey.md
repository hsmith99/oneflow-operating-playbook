# Meet, Join, Live, Stay â€” The Foundational Journey

Every Flow Neighbor is guided by our Onsite Team through a **Foundational Journey** â€” a consistent, intentional series of experiences designed to ensure every Neighbor feels safe, cared for, and connected.  

The Foundational Journey is not *the* Experience; it is the **framework** that allows our Teams to deliver the Flow Experience.  
It ensures we integrate every Neighbor into their community, understand what matters most to them, and connect them to the people, spaces, and opportunities that make life at Flow fulfilling.

---

## ðŸ§­ The Four Stages of the Journey

### 1. Meet
From the moment we meet a future Neighbor â€” online, over the phone, or on a tour â€” we begin introducing them to what makes Flow different.  
Every interaction is a chance to demonstrate our purpose and hospitality.

The goals of the *Meet* stage are:
- Introduce the Flow philosophy and lifestyle.
- Create trust and curiosity about what living here feels like.
- Ensure every prospect leaves with a sense of excitement and belonging.

**Key Moments:**
- Tour  
- Application & Lease  
- Pre-Move-In Check-In

---

### 2. Join
The Join stage is the most critical moment in the Neighbor Journey.  
When a person moves into Flow, they are most open to connection, belonging, and forming habits that shape their experience.

Our role is to make their transition effortless, personal, and meaningful â€” to transform new residents into true Neighbors.

**Key Moments:**
- Move-In Day  
- 48-Hour Check-In  
- Welcome Coffee  
- New Neighbor Dinner

> **Goal:** Integrate every new Neighbor into their community within their first 30 days.

---

### 3. Live
Once a Neighbor has joined the community, the focus shifts to consistency, care, and proactive connection.  
We build trust through everyday reliability, warmth, and operational excellence â€” and deepen belonging through personalized engagement.

Teams use this stage to both serve and listen â€” maintaining the Flow Experience across daily touchpoints while continuously learning how to improve.

**Our teamâ€™s role during Live:**
- Deliver Everyday Moments of Care with hospitality and precision.  
- Proactively check in and curate experiences based on the Neighborâ€™s needs.  
- Maintain responsiveness and transparency across all communication channels.

**Proactive Check-In Types:**
- Development Check-In  
- Standard Check-In  
- Pre-Renewal Check-In

---

### 4. Stay
The Stay stage is both an outcome and a moment of truth.  
It reflects whether weâ€™ve delivered on our promise of connection, care, and belonging.

When a Neighbor chooses to renew, itâ€™s more than a transaction â€” itâ€™s a commitment to continue their Flow journey with us.  
And when they move on, itâ€™s an opportunity to learn and grow.

**Goals of Stay:**
- Create renewal experiences that feel personal and valued.  
- Conduct meaningful departure check-ins to gather insights and maintain goodwill.  
- Celebrate long-term residents as the foundation of our communities.

> **Success in Stay means weâ€™ve fulfilled the mission of Flow: helping people live better, together.**

## ðŸ§© How the Foundational Journey Works

The Foundational Journey is both a **process** and a **philosophy**.  
It connects systems, roles, and experiences across the lifecycle of every Neighbor.

## ðŸ’¡ Why the Foundational Journey Matters

- It creates **clarity** â€” every team member knows what experience they own and when.  
- It ensures **consistency** â€” every Neighbor, in every building, receives the same quality of care.  
- It drives **belonging** â€” every stage builds upon the last to help Neighbors feel truly at home.

When we deliver the Foundational Journey with presence and precision,  
we transform residents into Neighbors â€” and Neighbors into community.

> **The Foundational Journey is how Flow turns process into experience, and experience into belonging.**
