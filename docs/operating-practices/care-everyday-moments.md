# Care – Everyday Moments

The Foundational Neighbor Journey empowers our Team to integrate each Neighbor into the community, understand what matters to them, and connect them to the people, spaces, and opportunities that make life at Flow fulfilling.  
But this is just the beginning.

Built on the trust and understanding we gain through that Journey, we are able to care and connect with our Neighbors — not only through major milestones, but through the small, meaningful moments that shape everyday life.

We believe that everyday life isn’t background noise — it’s the stage where connection, care, and joy are made real.  
From leaving their apartment and noticing the scent in the hallway, to the rhythm of the elevator, to the energy in the gym or coworking lounge, to returning home and being welcomed by name — each of these is a moment.  
A chance to show our Neighbors they’re seen.

These are **Everyday Moments** — quiet, human touchpoints where we demonstrate presence, learn who our Neighbors are, and design better ways to serve them.  
Some are individual, shaped by thoughtful design and reliability.  
Some are shared, created through intentional care and conversation.  
And some are unforgettable — unexpected gestures that spark delight and remind people why Flow feels different.

When we’re intentional with these moments, we don’t just meet needs — we build trust, invite joy, and foster belonging.  
That is what it means to deliver **Care** at Flow.

## 🧭 The Care Operating Practice

Our Operating Practice of **Care – Everyday Moments** has three pillars:

1. **Hospitality** – our staff caring for our Neighbors.  
2. **Community Commerce** – our platform that empowers Neighbors to care for each other.  
3. **Flow Services** – services that make daily life easier, operated by Flow or trusted partners.

Together, these pillars form the rhythm of life at Flow — connecting operational excellence with human warmth.

## 💙 1. Hospitality — The Heart of Flow

Hospitality is the lifeblood of the Flow Experience — the driving force of our communities.  
It’s our commitment to care and connect with everyone we meet.

Hospitality isn’t an action; it’s a mindset — a way of seeing others.  
At Flow, it’s guided by the simple acronym **O.N.E.**:

### O – Own the Experience  
Indirectly care for our Neighbors and Guests by taking ownership of every detail, even those outside your direct role.  
When you see a problem, fix it or ensure it gets resolved.  
Every Neighbor’s experience is *our* experience.

### N – Nurture Relationships  
Be curious about the person in front of you.  
Get to know them — whether it’s a front desk greeting, a coffee order, or a maintenance request.  
Every moment is a chance to build trust and connection.

### E – Evoke Joy  
When you nurture relationships, you learn what delights people.  
Use that knowledge to create surprise, happiness, and delight.  
Whether it’s remembering their favorite coffee or celebrating a milestone, small gestures create magic.

> **Hospitality is how we operationalize love.**  
> It turns service into care, and care into belonging.

## 🤝 2. Community Commerce — Neighbors Caring for Neighbors

True care doesn’t just flow from staff to Neighbor — it flows between Neighbors.  
Community Commerce is how we empower that exchange.

Through Flow’s internal platforms, Neighbors can:
- Offer their skills and services to one another (e.g., pet-sitting, fitness training, photography).  
- Participate in peer-to-peer “Acts of Flow,” earning Drops for helping others.  
- Use the **Drops** system to reward generosity and reinforce community contribution.

Community Commerce turns everyday generosity into a shared economy of care — reinforcing Flow’s mission to help people live better, together.

## 🧺 3. Flow Services — Simplifying Daily Life

Flow Services are offerings designed to make everyday living effortless, freeing our Neighbors to focus on what matters most.

These include:
- **Housekeeping and Laundry Services**  
- **Pet Care**  
- **Fitness and Wellness Sessions**  
- **Local Vendor Partnerships** (e.g., car cleaning, styling, and catering)

Each service reflects Flow’s standard of hospitality and reliability, whether managed internally or through carefully vetted partners.

## 🧠 How We Operationalize Care

Delivering Care – Everyday Moments requires both consistency and heart.  
Operationally, that means:

- **Systems:** Use Carson, Slack, and Zendesk to track, communicate, and resolve daily interactions.  
- **Touchpoints:** Ensure every Front Desk, Maintenance, and Housekeeping interaction is personal, prompt, and proactive.  
- **Feedback:** Collect and act on Neighbor feedback through Typeform and Zendesk reports.  
- **Measurement:** Track “Moments of Care” — compliments, resolved issues, and acts of hospitality — as key performance metrics.

When care becomes part of the system, it becomes the culture.

## 🪶 The Outcome

Care – Everyday Moments transforms a building into a sanctuary —  
A place where operations, design, and humanity intersect.  
Where people feel known, valued, and connected — not because of grand gestures, but because of how we show up every day.

> **Care is not what we do when something goes wrong.  
It’s how we operate when everything is right.**
