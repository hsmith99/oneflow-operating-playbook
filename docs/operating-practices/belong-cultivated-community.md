# Belong – Cultivated Community

When our Neighbors feel **Safe and Secure** — and deeply **Valued and Cared For** — they begin to seek something more: a sense of **Belonging**.  
They want to connect with others, explore their passions, and root themselves in something larger than just a place to live.

Flow’s **Belong – Cultivated Community** Operating Practice defines how we create the conditions for that belonging to grow.  
It has three outcomes that guide our work:

- **Oneness with Your Community**  
- **Oneness with Yourself**  
- **Oneness with Your Work**

## 🌍 Oneness with Your Community

True belonging can’t be manufactured or imposed — it’s shaped by the people who live it.  
That’s why, at Flow, we empower our Neighbors to create the community they want to belong to through the **Flow Belonging Platform**.

### The Flow Belonging Platform
The Flow Belonging Platform has three pillars — **Organization, Leadership, and Incentives** — that together cultivate thriving communities led by our Neighbors.

#### 1. Organization
Flow communities are organized into **Flow Groups**, each centered around shared passions:
- Fitness, Sports & Wellbeing  
- Food, Drink & Nightlife  
- Music, Art & Culture  
- Work & Entrepreneurship  
- Pets & Families  

Within each Group, smaller **Flow Clubs** form naturally — neighbors gathering around specific interests or activities.  
Flow Groups live in WhatsApp, where members connect, share, and plan.  
This structure transforms interest into connection — and connection into community.

#### 2. Community Leadership
We believe in empowering our Neighbors to lead.  
In each community, we select and support five **Flow Ambassadors**, one for each Flow Group.  
Ambassadors are trained and resourced to cultivate engagement — starting Clubs, hosting events, welcoming new Neighbors, and encouraging participation.

Each Ambassador receives a small monthly budget to organize gatherings and initiatives.  
They’re supported by the **Community Engagement Lead**, who provides guidance, tracks impact, and ensures alignment with Flow’s mission.

#### 3. Incentives
Belonging is built on participation.  
To reward and encourage active engagement, we use the **Drops Platform** — Flow’s community points system.  
Neighbors earn Drops for **Acts of Flow** such as:
- Hosting an event  
- Starting a Flow Club  
- Referring a friend to tour or move in  
- Helping other Neighbors connect  

Ambassadors earn Drops for both their own Acts of Flow and those they facilitate within their Groups.

> **The Flow Belonging Platform empowers Neighbors to lead and belong — turning connection into culture.**

## 🌱 Oneness with Yourself

Belonging begins internally — in the confidence and wellbeing that come from feeling grounded and supported.  
At Flow, we help Neighbors cultivate **Oneness with themselves** through spaces, programs, and services designed to nourish physical, mental, and creative wellness.

We do this through:
- **Classes and Programming:**  
  Daily sessions across fitness, movement, music, education, and wellness — often led by Neighbors themselves.  
  These classes create daily rituals of connection and self-improvement.

- **Wellbeing Amenities:**  
  Flow gyms are powered by Technogym and complemented by cold plunges, saunas, steam rooms, yoga rooms, and music studios.  
  Every space is designed to support presence, recovery, and growth.

- **Partnerships and Experiences:**  
  Flow partners with experts, local practitioners, and Neighbor-led services to bring new forms of wellbeing into our communities.

> **When Neighbors thrive as individuals, the community thrives with them.**

## 💼 Oneness with Your Work

Most of our Neighbors work from home multiple times per week — which means that home must also support productivity, creativity, and purpose.  
Flow helps Neighbors find **Oneness with their Work** by integrating professional connection and opportunity into community life.

We do this by providing:
- **Coworking and Focus Spaces:**  
  Thoughtfully designed shared and private workspaces, micro-offices, and podcast studios.
- **Networking and Professional Events:**  
  Regular opportunities to connect with other professionals and entrepreneurs.  
  Many Flow events bridge community and career.
- **Flow Marketplace:**  
  An internal marketplace that enables Neighbors to offer their goods and services to the community.  
  Many of our Neighbors make money simply by living in Flow.

> **Work at Flow isn’t separate from life — it’s integrated into a holistic sense of purpose, connection, and creativity.**

## 🔁 The Practice of Belonging

Cultivated Community is not static — it’s dynamic, evolving with every Neighbor who joins and every connection that’s made.  
This Operating Practice requires our Onsite Teams to:
- Empower rather than manage.  
- Support Ambassadors with care and consistency.  
- Track engagement, feedback, and wellbeing metrics to understand community health.  
- Celebrate participation — not just attendance.

When we create the right conditions — structure, leadership, and incentives — our Neighbors do the rest.  
They build belonging together.

> **Belong – Cultivated Community turns residents into Neighbors, and Neighbors into a community.**
