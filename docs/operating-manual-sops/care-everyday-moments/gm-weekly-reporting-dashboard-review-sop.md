> ðŸ”— **[Quick Link: Jump to Process](#process)**

## Goals
| **Type** | **Goal** |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Operational** | Establish systematic weekly review of Sigma dashboards to monitor property health, financial performance, operational metrics, and community engagement.

**Frequency:** Weekly review session scheduled every **Monday morning** (or first business day of the week).

**Time Allocation:** 45-60 minutes for comprehensive dashboard review and action planning.

**Excludes:** Daily operational checks (covered in daily workflows), ad-hoc reporting requests, and real-time monitoring dashboards accessed throughout the week.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities
**Process Owner:** **General Manager** â€” accountable for weekly review execution, action planning, and follow-up.  
**Deputy:** **Assistant General Manager** (executes review if GM unavailable on Monday)

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **General Manager** | Conducts comprehensive weekly Sigma dashboard review on Monday morning (or first business day), identifies trends and outliers, documents insights, creates action plans, communicates findings to leadership team, and tracks action item completion. |
| **Assistant General Manager** | Acts as deputy for review execution if GM unavailable on Monday. Provides operational context and data verification during review sessions, executes action items assigned during review, and supports GM with on-the-ground validation of dashboard metrics. |
| **Operations Manager** | Provides hotel/residential operations context, validates front desk and guest experience metrics, and implements operational improvements identified during review. |
| **Regional Director of Operations** | Reviews GM dashboard review notes and action plans, provides strategic guidance, and ensures property-level insights inform regional strategy. |

## Systems & Tools
| **System** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Sigma** | Primary analytics platform providing real-time dashboards on property health, financial performance, leasing metrics, operations, and community engagement. Frontend UI for Snowflake data warehouse. |
| **Snowflake** | Data warehouse containing cleaned, transformed, and aggregated data from Yardi Voyager, Moved, Zendesk, Carson, and other Flow systems. |
| **Yardi Voyager** | Source system for residential financials, lease data, unit status, and AR/collections metrics displayed in Sigma. |
| **Moved** | Source system for move-in readiness, completion rates, and Neighbor onboarding metrics. |
| **Zendesk** | Source system for support ticket volume, response times, resolution rates, and satisfaction scores. |
| **Carson/Flow App** | Source system for amenity usage, delivery metrics, and engagement activity. |

**Integration Notes:**  
- Sigma dashboards pull data from Snowflake (updated nightly via data pipelines)  
- Yardi â†’ Snowflake â†’ Sigma decisions are updated within 24 hours  
- Real-time metrics (occupancy, Zendesk tickets) refresh more frequently  
- Historical trends and aggregations may take up to 48 hours to reflect in dashboards  

**Fail-Safes:**  
- **Sigma Unavailable:** GM accesses Yardi Voyager reports directly and documents review in weekly notes template. Escalate to Data & Analytics team for system status.  
- **Snowflake Data Delay:** GM verifies data freshness timestamp. If > 48 hours old, proceed with available data and note limitations in review notes.  
- **Dashboard Missing/Inaccessible:** Document missing dashboard in review notes, contact Data & Analytics team for immediate restoration, and use backup reports from source systems.

---

## Triggers
- **Primary Trigger:** Start of business week (Monday morning or first business day)  
- **System Chain:** Weekly calendar reminder â†’ Access Sigma workspace â†’ Navigate to Property Dashboard Collection â†’ Begin systematic review  
- **Readiness Gate:** All required dashboards must be accessible and data must be current (within 48 hours). If gate fails, proceed with available data and document limitations.  
- **Deputy Trigger:** If GM is unavailable on Monday, AGM automatically executes review by end of first business day  
- **Fail-Safe:** If Sigma is unavailable, GM accesses Yardi Voyager reports directly and documents review in weekly notes template
