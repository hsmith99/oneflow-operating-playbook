1. **Daily Coordination:** AGM messages cleaning company via Slack with units to clean tomorrow
2. **Deep Clean:** Cleaning company performs comprehensive deep cleaning
3. **Confirmation:** Cleaning company completes Cleaning Completion typeform

### **Final Inspection**
1. **AGM Inspection:** AGM conducts post-cleaning inspection via Final Unit Inspection typeform
2. **Leasing Agent Inspection:** Leasing Agent conducts final pre-move-in inspection via Final Unit Inspection typeform
3. **Unit Ready Status:** AGM reviews all completed typeforms and updates unit status to "Ready" in Yardi
