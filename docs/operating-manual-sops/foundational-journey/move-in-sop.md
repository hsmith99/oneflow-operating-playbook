3. **Confirmation:** Cleaning company completes Cleaning Completion typeform

### **Final Inspection**
1. **AGM Inspection:** AGM conducts post-cleaning inspection via Final Unit Inspection typeform
2. **Leasing Agent Inspection:** Leasing Agent conducts final pre-move-in inspection via Final Unit Inspection typeform
3. **Unit Ready Status:** AGM reviews all completed typeforms and updates unit status to "Ready" in Yardi

> ðŸ”¹ **Cross-Reference:** For complete details on this process, including typeform structures and quality standards, see [Unit Move-In Readiness SOP](unit-move-in-readiness-sop.md).
