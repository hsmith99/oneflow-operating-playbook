**Escalation Ladder:**  
Maintenance/Housekeeping â†’ Operations Manager â†’ AGM â†’ GM â†’ Regional Operations

---

## Systems & Tools
- **Yardi Voyager:** Unit status and move-in scheduling
- **Moved:** Readiness checklist and photo documentation
- **Waves:** Maintenance work order tracking and completion
- **Carson:** Access system testing and key preparation
- **Sigma:** Design Your Flow survey data for personalization

> ðŸ”¹ **Tech Note:** Moved syncs nightly with Yardi Voyager. Unit cannot be marked "Ready" until all checklist items are complete and photos uploaded.

---

## Triggers
- **Primary Trigger:** Move-in scheduled 48 hours in advance in Yardi Voyager
- **System Chain:** Yardi syncs overnight â†’ Moved generates readiness checklist â†’ tasks assigned to Maintenance and Housekeeping
- **Fail-Safe:** If sync fails by 8 AM local, Operations Manager manually creates Moved record and alerts AGM
- **Readiness Gate:** Unit cannot be released until Moved shows "Unit Ready" status and AGM approves "Go"
