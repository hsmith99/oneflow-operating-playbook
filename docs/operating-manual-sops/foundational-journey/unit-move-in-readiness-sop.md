## Systems & Tools
- **Neighbor CRM & Move-in Tracker** â€” Source of truth for unit turn/make ready status (Google Sheets)
- **Typeform** â€” Three inspection forms: Maintenance, Cleaning, Final Unit Inspection
- **Slack** â€” Real-time notifications from typeform submissions to dedicated channels
- **Yardi Voyager** â€” Unit status and move-in scheduling (status updated when unit ready)
- **Waves** â€” Maintenance work order tracking and completion
- **Google Scripts** â€” Automated status updates to Neighbor CRM & Move-in Tracker

> ðŸ”¹ **Tech Note:** Typeform responses automatically flow to Slack and update Neighbor CRM & Move-in Tracker via Google Scripts. Unit status in Yardi is updated when unit is marked ready.  
> ðŸ”¹ **Data Flow:** Typeform â†’ Slack â†’ Google Scripts â†’ Neighbor CRM & Move-in Tracker â†’ Yardi

---

## Triggers
- **Primary Trigger:** Unit needs to be prepared for move-in (either post-construction in lease-up or unit turn after previous resident)
- **System Chain:** Neighbor CRM & Move-in Tracker identifies unit â†’ Work orders created in Waves â†’ Typeform inspections completed â†’ Status updates via Google Scripts
- **Fail-Safe:** If typeform submissions fail, manual status updates can be made directly in Neighbor CRM & Move-in Tracker
- **Readiness Gate:** Unit cannot be marked ready until:
  - All Waves work orders completed
  - Post-maintenance inspection passed (Maintenance Manager)
  - Cleaning completed and confirmed
  - Final inspections passed (AGM & Leasing Agent)

---
