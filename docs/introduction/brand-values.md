# Flow Brand Values

Flow’s culture is grounded in four simple but powerful values that guide every action, decision, and interaction across our communities and teams.

### ❤️ LOVE  
We lead with empathy, care, and respect.  
We make every Neighbor and team member feel seen and valued.

### 🤝 GIVE  
We serve generously.  
We offer our time, our attention, and our effort before being asked.

### 🔥 COMMIT  
We take ownership.  
We hold ourselves and each other to the highest standards and finish what we start.

### 🌱 GROW  
We pursue progress.  
We embrace curiosity, feedback, and continuous improvement — personally and collectively.

> **These values shape how we operate, how we care, and how we connect.**
