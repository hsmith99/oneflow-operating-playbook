# Flow Leadership Principles

Flow’s leadership principles define how we lead ourselves, our teams, and our communities. They are not reserved for managers — they are expectations for everyone at Flow, because leadership is a behavior, not a title.

## 1. Act Like an Owner
Take initiative. Own outcomes. Treat every building, every process, and every Neighbor like they are yours.

**Behaviors in Action:**
- Identify problems and solve them without waiting for instruction.
- Protect resources and make decisions with long-term value in mind.
- Take pride in every aspect of the Flow Experience.

> Ownership is about care and accountability — we don’t pass the buck, we pass the baton.

---

## 2. Relentlessly High Standards
Set the bar high and refuse to compromise on quality, hospitality, or integrity. Excellence is how we honor the trust of our Neighbors and our teams.

**Behaviors in Action:**
- Hold yourself and others to measurable standards.
- Inspect what you expect — follow through on details.
- Never walk past something that could be better.

> High standards protect the integrity of our brand and the safety of our communities.

## 3. Ship Now
Speed matters. Progress beats perfection. We believe in taking action, learning fast, and improving continuously.

**Behaviors in Action:**
- Deliver what’s needed today — don’t wait for ideal conditions.
- Communicate transparently and follow up quickly.
- Celebrate momentum, not just milestones.

> The Flow Experience is built one action at a time — done well and done now.

## 4. 1 + 1 = 11
Collaboration multiplies impact. We achieve more together than we ever could alone.

**Behaviors in Action:**
- Build bridges between teams and communities.
- Share credit and take collective responsibility.
- Ask for help early and offer it freely.

> Great communities — and great companies — are built through shared purpose and connection.

## Leading the Flow Way
Leadership at Flow is about modeling the culture we want to build. These principles are not separate from our daily operations — they *are* our daily operations.

> We lead by example, with humility, urgency, and care — turning every moment into an opportunity to build belonging.
