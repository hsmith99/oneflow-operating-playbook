The path to that while we are using Yardi is quite painful.   </li> <li>What Xuan Mai has done is write data pipelines to clean, transform, aggregate, and join and write the resulting datasets to Snowflake, our data warehouse.   </li> <li>As a UI frontend to Snowflake we use Sigma, which is the entry point for our data stakeholders and consumers.  </li> <li>Dashboards are viewed every day  </li> <li>Property Health Scorecard is rich in information, manifested in a way that does not appear in Yardi at all.  </li> <li>Xuan Mai uses Yardi -   </li> <li>People usually come to the team with a specific ask, or an ambiguous ask.  </li> <li>For example, do we know what the average tenure of resident  </li> <li>In asking questions about the need, they tease out usecases and potential visualizations of the data.  </li> <li>Very familiar with the 15 or so core tables in Yardi  </li> <li>When she gets an ask, she\u2019ll initially write some quick Sigma to get a quick intuition into whether or not we can even answer the question and how long the solution might take.  </li> <li>If there are explorations that are easier to do in python, she will start a Jupyter notebook to play around with how she wants to model the data and express it in python in the future.  <ul> <li>It\u2019s quite messy to transform a lot of the data.  </li> <li>We are getting to a point where we have an understanding of the data model necessary to produce answers effectively.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>After completing the initial exploration, she will go into the Yardi UI and into Yardi Data Model documentation (Voyager 7S Data Dictionary)  <ul> <li>Spends a lot of time hunting in this document and hoping for the best. Some tables are well documented, others have no descriptions at all.  </li> <li>Often need to make an educated guess on the meaning of a field. If she has to guess, she will work with the internal Yardi Team, predominantly Llu, to check.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Spent a lot of time understanding pricing data, amenity tags, and unit statuses.   </li> <li>Will often go into the interface and look at different units, comparing what Yardi shows to what she is seeing in the tables after doing initial exploration and engineering.  </li> <li>Yardi does not have a master table of all of the Leases.  </li> <li>Tenant table is either a mixed use or misnamed table or the table has evolved over time.  <ul> <li>From the tenant table you can surmise what the most recent lease is for a given tenant.  </li> <li>But one of the most common asks from our data stakeholders is a view into historic data.  </li> <li>To serve this ask, because Yardi does not have a true concept of a Lease.  <ul> <li>Lease History table is essentially an event table of all the events that may occur on a Lease. One might think that there would be a master table of all the Leases that have ever existed, but there is not. It has to be derived from the Lease History table -&gt; events that indicate a unique Lease, for which we create our own unique ID.  </li> <li>The Lease should tell you who, where, when, etc.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Lease table in Snowflake takes all the data in the tenant table, assuming it is the most recent lease for a tenant, and then fill in the historic leases and rents from the lease history table.   </li> <li>The challenge with this is that the Lease History table is accurate from the time that we take over a lease. Therefore when we take over a building that is already occupied, we ingest data from all the current residents, but we might not ingest past resident data, leasing to an incomplete historic view of the building\u2019s performance before we take over.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Xuan Mai feels like we have hardly scratched the surface, even if we are doing better from an analytics point of view than other multifamily companies.  </li> <li>Only use Voyager, though will sometimes peruse RentCafe Sitemanager to see what is published on the ILSs.   </li> <li>Spends a little time in the reports area.   </li> <li>Occasionally uses the Unit Availability Details report to spot check our data and to understand what our stakeholders are looking at.  </li> <li>Because Yardi has so many aspects, there is not one team member to go to about the underlying business rules around all the ways it works. For example, logic around ILS rules.  </li> <li>Specifically, she wants to know when does a unit actually get advertised on an ILS, or how often listings are refreshed to make sure the data we are materializing is timely and accurate and to understand how numbers we see in the tables come to be.  </li> <li>Often the biggest challenge is that we don\u2019t have visibility into how Yardi\u2019s system works. For instance, how they publish to the ILSs.  </li> <li>Is Yardi accurate? Do we do testing using Yardi? To what extent?  </li> <li>Yardi is consistent, but not necessarily accurate. There is a big difference between these two things.   </li> <li>Assumptions that you bake into data and information need to be consistent. Because Yardi is the incumbent, it is very consistent, and so people adopt Yardi\u2019s assumptions and believe the data to be accurate.  </li> <li>So far the team has largely avoided financial reporting and analytics and so is not using, or planning to use the ledger suite.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/How%20Flow%20uses%20Yardi/#engineering","title":"Engineering","text":""},{"location":"resources/How%20Flow%20uses%20Yardi/#asa-engineering-lead-website","title":"Asa - Engineering Lead, Website","text":"<ul> <li>\u201cYardi is a beast.
