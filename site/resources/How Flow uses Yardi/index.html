Status: <strong>Draft</strong> | In-Review | Final</p>
<h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This document comprises detailed notes from internal user research sessions with team members from every function of Flow that engages with Yardi. In each session, the goal was to understand and capture how that individual uses and depends on Yardi to fulfill their responsibilities. Throughout, I sought to gather a sense of their key pain points, and the things they like most about the system. Each session was recorded, and you can find the recordings linked below. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the information below is distilled into a map of every feature of Yardi we use by its importance to each function of the business. Importance is subjective, of course. However, the ‘Importance Scoring’, if you will, is based on how critical the feature or functionality is to the responsibilities of that function of the business, based on the interviews below. You can find this map here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/13O5BLxcCKWxYFkBzA7EsrcwtecraN4i8IfQlkITg5ec/edit">Yardi: Feature \&lt;&gt; Business Function Importance Map</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Team works from their Jira support ticket board, assigning tickets to themselves based on their specialities.  </li>
<li>Working across all the modules, though most of the admin functionality is in Voyager.  </li>
<li>Typical Admin Usecases:  </li>
<li>Adding GL Codes  </li>
<li>Formatting and building the Account Trees based on GL codes  <ul>
<li>For most Financial Reports we have a custom account tree. If the option is not there we use the Yardi default.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Team also helps the business units to complete tasks that they could have completed themselves.  </li>
<li>Team will also spend time correcting manual errors on the ledger eg. a double charge on a lease.  </li>
<li>Transitions:  </li>
<li>Will load cleaned data in via an ETL report into Yardi.  </li>
<li>Also upload Sonder rent payments through ETL.  </li>
<li>Bulk payments added to the ledger (for Commercial leases)  </li>

<ul>
<li>Llu is essentially our Yardi plumber, making sure things run smoothly through the Yardi pipes.  </li>
<li>Anything that touches resident or staff experience  </li>
<li>Any data issues  </li>
<li>Reporting  </li>
<li>Automated tasks to take administrative burden off of the Staff  </li>
<li>At its core Voyager is a big accounting database with other functionality built on top of it  </li>
<li>A product of it’s time eg. created for a nuclear household with a primary tenant  </li>
<li>In the real work multiple people can be on a lease, in Voyager the primary tenant is the first class citizen in terms of data and processes.  <ul>
<li>Roommates have to be promoted to the status of a primary tenant.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Over time Voyager has been built upon to serve various usecases.   </li>
<li>In the database there is one large table called Trans with over 100 columns with different types of transactions  </li>
<li>Register Report in Yardi lets you see all the transactions  </li>
<li>Consider this the master ledger for the entire system  <ul>
<li>Work to the individual ledger from hPerson field  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every single charge is part of a batch  </li>
<li>By design  </li>
<li>Every charge has a batch number on it  </li>
<li>We post rent charges each day in a single batch  </li>
<li>When people make payments they go into a batch  </li>
<li>A batch is usually a set of common transactions  </li>
<li>Though you can create a manual match  </li>
<li>In the scope of Voyager a tenant is a Lease  </li>
<li>If a tenant renews their lease they remain on the same ledger  </li>
<li>Roommates share the same ledger on the lease  </li>
<li>Everything in Rentcafe CRM Flex is a more focused version of Voyager, focused on Leasing.   </li>
<li>Though in Voyager you cannot search as cleanly, at an individual level, as you can in CRM Flex.  <ul>
<li>Much easier to search for documents; send invites to the apps; and see the relationship between different residents.  </li>
<li>Easier to find work orders at the individual level  </li>
<li>More focused on the resident experience, at least for support.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Llu transforms excel sheets into SQL statements to add term based pricing in bulk  </li>
<li>To do this manually you would have to go unit by unit via the CRM Flex  </li>
<li>Llu produces custom reports and sets up reports in Voyager  </li>
<li>Including automated reports  </li>
<li>Llu sets up the different Yardi modules, like ScreeningWorks or Procure to Pay  </li>
<li>Llu also manages the Yardi file tree  </li>
<li>Attachments loaded in when we do a transition  </li>
<li>Transitions:  </li>
<li>If the other management company uses Yardi, it’s 1-1  </li>
<li>If the management company uses a different software, their objects and tables need to be converted to our formats.  </li>
<li>There is a dark period when everything happens manually and in paper at the property (4-7 days)   <ul>
<li>Takes time to bring everything in in ETL files  </li>
<li>Data dumps in Excel, CSVs, Json  </li>
<li>Manipulate them as necessary  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use Redirect consulting services to support the transitions.  </li>
<li>Elevate (focuses on particular modules)  </li>
<li>Included Maintenance IQ  </li>
<li>Payment Processing and Procure to Pay   <ul>
<li>We use Yardi’s payment processor within the Rentcafe application  </li>
<li>Llu is not sure how the payment processor works</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Mostly use Voyager and the CRM  </li>
<li>Use the CRM to make sure the team is completing their responsibilities like clearing the queue; clean the MeetElise queue.  <ul>
<li>Uses the CRM to hold the team accountable  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mostly use Voyager for Reporting  </li>
<li>Look at tour notes for all properties, ensuring the team adds notes and getting insight into the state of the leasing flow.  <ul>
<li>For example, interested in the feedback on the converted RBBs  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uses Voyager to cross-check Sigma  <ul>
<li>BoxScore Summary  </li>
<li>Unit Availability Detail  </li>
<li>Rent Roll  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also uses Voyager to analyze why trends look the way they do in Sigma  <ul>
<li>Use Yardi to dive into the database  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doesn’t go into the ledgers very much, though will when we focus more on the Revenue number and less on Occupancy.  </li>
<li>Looks at the ledger every month in the financials  </li>
<li>Uses AP workflows to approve marketing spend at the property level  </li>
<li>People consider Yardi to be the truth because it is the source of truth, biasing us to not check for manual errors</li>

<ul>
<li>Voyager  </li>
<li>Property manager is critical to leveraging Yardi at the building - sitting in the middle of the web  </li>
<li>Reports  <ul>
<li>Set up favorite reports:  </li>
<li>Residential   </li>
<li>Leverage the calendar on the activities happening in the day  </li>
<li>Move-ins and move-outs show Johnny’s workload  </li>
<li>Don’t really use the unit reporting - Sigma is better  </li>
<li>Exporting to Excel is used heavily  </li>
<li>Eg. exporting delinquency report; or vehicle report  </li>
<li>Used to filter for specific usecases and questions  </li>
<li>Daily Activity Report  </li>
<li>Focused on Month to Month  </li>
<li>Resident activity detail  </li>
<li>A load of individual reports  </li>
<li>Leverage for monthly renewal bonuses  </li>
<li>Leverage to cross reference with commission report from Leasing Manager - number of Move-ins.  </li>
<li>Resident activity high level  </li>
<li>Core metrics over a custom timeframe  </li>
<li>Can go into detail from here and then use excel  </li>
<li>Each blue hyperlink allows us to go into a detailed report for each metric  </li>
<li>Eviction report  </li>
<li>Then export to excel and do the analysis themself  </li>
<li>BoxScore Summary  </li>
<li>Availability  </li>
<li>Resident Activity  </li>
<li>Conversion Rates  <ul>
<li>Essentially a Leasing Dashboard  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For those who provide Notice - we only find out why they provide notice after they move-out (their move-out reason)  </li>
<li>Favorite report: Unit statistics  </li>
<li>All the information I care about when it comes to our rent growth  </li>
<li>Market rent - what we are offering  </li>
<li>Also gives you rent per square foot  <ul>
<li>Always wants to know this  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use this report over the Effective Rent report, which is sometimes wrong  </li>
<li>Other than for Occupancy, I don’t use Sigma  </li>
<li>12 month occupancy never works  </li>
<li>Would be amazing to have  </li>
<li>Why is this?  </li>
<li>Concession burn-off is a really good report - used to calculate how much we will spend on concessions each month  </li>
<li>Helps you know when to drop concessions off  </li>
<li>Will use every month if we are concession heavy  </li>
<li>Lease expiration - used to try and offer longer or shorter leases to amortize expirations and even them out.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financials  <ul>
<li>Use the Financials section to produce variance reports each month for the Accounting Team. Working with Robert on the Accounting Team.  </li>
<li>Adding notes directly in Yardi  </li>
<li>Notes on variance between budget and actual  </li>
<li>Notes on bills on General Ledgers are linked to in the variance report and used to add high-level notes for each line-item in the variance report.  <ul>
<li>If the notes from the bill are reflected on the variance report it would save 3-4 hours at least on the days when this report needs to be compiled.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General Ledger report  </li>
<li>Used to get into the detail of why we spend what  </li>
<li>Will often export to excel to be able to filter  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AP/AR  <ul>
<li>Invoice Register  </li>
<li>Used to approve invoices that are added  </li>
<li>Important to add detailed notes  </li>
<li>Cross-reference charges with invoices  </li>
<li>If Chris is unsure, he screenshots and speaks with Evelyn to resolve it  </li>
<li>Does this daily  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resident Support/Issue Resolution  <ul>
<li>Use resident person record to get contact information to reach out to a resident and understand charges on their ledger  </li>
<li>Use work order function to check on the status of individual work orders when residents complain.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prospect Guest Card  <ul>
<li>Used to verify different commissions - eg broker commission invoice  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not using Yardi to manage the Security team  </li>
<li>Never goes into other Yardi modules  </li>
<li>“I perceive it as an accounting platform for analytics.”  </li>
<li>I would love to know when elevators are being reserved; when vendors are coming to the property.  <ul>
<li>More of the operations of the property</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>‘Sometimes you love it, sometimes you hate it’  </li>
<li>Used to use Onesite, and found it to be more user friendly  </li>
<li>Just use Voyager and occasionally ScreeningWorks  </li>
<li>Perceives his role and making sure everything is recorded and accurate in the system  </li>
<li>Particularly the collections part  </li>
<li>Every day, look at ‘Move-ins’  - ‘future’ residents that need to be added to the system as a resident  </li>
<li>If someone is transferring units they shows up here  </li>
<li>Go to the move-in statement and check that it matches the system  </li>
<li>Once you hit the ‘Move-in’ function, they system produces the charges the resident needs to pay and we need to check if the move-in statement reconciles.  </li>
<li>Update the Agent to the Leasing Specialist  </li>
<li>From time to time the Leasing Agent will do the math wrong calculating Move-in charges  <ul>
<li>Manually produce the move-in statements  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need to select each charge to add them to the ledger  </li>
<li>After checking - ‘post’ the move-in  </li>
<li>Then go back to the ledger and check everything is accurate  </li>
<li>Process move-in cheques with the Yardi System Checkscan (only cashier’s cheque)  </li>
<li>Use Checks because we require certified funds  </li>
<li>‘If you let someone pay online they can dispute that later on if they want to’  </li>
<li>Also reconcile resident ledger charges using their profile eg. to see if they have a vehicle.  </li>
<li>If a resident pays too much they will automatically get a credit  </li>
<li>Yardi will automatically switch utility charges if a resident transfers.  </li>
<li>Conservice is integrated into Yardi and they add utilities to the resident automatically.  </li>
<li>Conservice sends Johnny a report to review each month and once he gives them the green light they add the utilities to the system. Manual review.  </li>
<li>Renter’s Insurance  </li>
<li>Assurant tracks policies for us  </li>
<li>Also review insurance on the data -&gt; Renter’s Insurance interface.  <ul>
<li>Double checking that we have received everything (before residents move-in)  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the lease agreement (name, apartment number, lease dates)  </li>
<li>Check that the Early Termination amount is correct  </li>
<li>Check that the Lease has all the right addendums eg. pet addendums  </li>
<li>Extremely manual and detail oriented  </li>
<li>Keep track of changes from this auditing in a google sheet  </li>
<li>Move-outs  </li>
<li>Make sure we get the physical keys before moving them out.  <ul>
<li>Ensure we don’t make the unit ready until they have truly left  </li>
<li>Just move the resident out (change of status)  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once a resident is Moved out, they move to the Deposit Accounting tab  </li>
<li>Close the ledger, close the account - creating the move-out statement  </li>
<li>Try and complete within 5 days of the resident moving out  </li>
<li>Florida Law: resident must receive move-out statement within 30 days of moving out  </li>
<li>Check if the resident gave ‘proper notice’ (60 day notice, else 1 month of rent insufficient notice fee)  </li>
<li>Check that utilities are applied correctly up to the move-out day  <ul>
<li>Check on the ledger  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Move-out statement generation: function -&gt; Deposit Accounting  <ul>
<li>Do it largely based on the history of the resident  </li>
<li>Initial scan to see if anything seems off, and then investigate by reconciling with Conservice  </li>
<li>Check maintenance inspection of the unit prior to completing the Move-out statement, applying damage charges as necessary.  </li>
<li>Inspection is completed by the technician via a Google Form, with responses in a Google sheet, including links to photos that are stored in the drive.  </li>
<li>The Assistant PM reviews the photos and makes the final judgment.  </li>
<li>Check the handwritten move-out form and verify that we have an address to send the cheque to and input that address to the Forwarding Address field.  </li>
<li>We send one cheque with multiple names if roommates are on the lease. To one forwarding address.  </li>
<li>Add Move-out statements to the resident’s account.  </li>
<li>Use Zendesk to communicate with the residents even post-move-out - allows RX team to support with questions or issues.  </li>
<li>Accounting sends cheques to the residents.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: utility charges are two months delayed ie. in march you pay january’s utilities  </li>
<li>Everyone comes to the Assistant PM for any lease related charges  </li>
<li>Apply late fees properly on the 6th day of each month and then create three-day letters to pay or vacate (manually, posted on the door).  </li>
<li>To get the report of all residents with a balance (that haven’t paid their rent yet): Reports -&gt; Receivables -&gt; Residential Analytics -&gt; Financial Aged Receiveables -&gt; Summary type: Resident  </li>
<li>Uses this report to update a google sheet tracker (Delinquency) for each month and add notes.  </li>
<li>Have to actively seek out the information - no alerts from Yardi  </li>
<li>No way to track delinquency over time or collection of late funds over time.  <ul>
<li>Keen to see collection percentage  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combine with the rent roll to get the month-to-date billing  </li>
<li>Roommates that are on the lease are equally responsible for every charge on the lease, regardless of how the Yardi interface shows the roommates.  </li>
<li>There is a lease, then a ledger  </li>
<li>Use Yardi to send create notice to cure documents to residents</li>

<li>Use Voyager every single day  </li>
<li>Only use CRM if she is helping the leasing team with something  </li>
<li>Check on Pending Applications  </li>
<li>Always look at Move-ins, Move-outs, and Deposit Accounting  </li>
<li>Move-ins  </li>
<li>Walk the apartments in addition to the Leasing team  </li>
<li>Move-outs  </li>
<li>Do the move-out inspections with the Maintenance supervisor  </li>
<li>Run water, run the dishwasher  </li>
<li>Have 5 days to close out Deposit Accounting  </li>
<li>Have 15 days to notify the resident if we make a claim against their security deposit  </li>
<li>Note: rent responsible residents pay (and have a move out date) until their lease ends or we find someone to take over the lease.  </li>
<li>Confirmation - keys returned or written - to go into the apartment after they move-out  </li>
<li>Deposit accounting  </li>
<li>Create the move-out statement of final charges  </li>
<li>Go to the post office every friday and send their move out statement (from Yardi) and a notice to impose claim (from their security deposit) via certified mail to their new address.  </li>
<li>Have to do everyone who moves out in a week in that week  </li>
<li>Pull delinquency reports every day  </li>
<li>Receivable Analytics -&gt; delinquency only  </li>
<li>Post three day notice to pay on the monday following the first day of the month  </li>
<li>And close their online account  <ul>
<li>Change via their profile -&gt; Late Fee &amp; Account  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only take payment via a cashiers check  </li>
<li>If residents don’t pay, evict them via their profile (initially set move-out date to next year because we don’t know when we will get them out of the unit, then update the move-out date when we do)  </li>
<li>Writ of possession (sheriff comes and takes back possession of the apartment)  </li>
<li>Resident Analytics -&gt; renTo give Roxana a better understanding of financials for her financials call  </li>
<li>t roll to see the difference between market and actual rents week over week  </li>
<li>Leverage slack to manage charges to existing residents (particularly over the weekend)  </li>
<li>Add charges via the resident’s profile -&gt; quick charge is a big functions we use (one time)  </li>
<li>Residents are asked to pay the one time fees in full immediately  <ul>
<li>Until it is paid for we don’t give them things, even fobs  </li>
<li>If Michelle is here we get them to pay on the spot if they need something immediately  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or add a Lease Charge -&gt; recurring charge  </li>
<li>Attachments are really important  </li>
<li>Team labels attachments in the ‘Type’ field to organize appropriately  </li>
<li>Adding attachments is extremely time consuming in Voyager (easy in CRM)  </li>
<li>Eg. for notices to enter posted on door, Michelle scans the file and then adds it to the profile  </li>
<li>Michelle adds renewal proposals (for the leasing team) manually  </li>
<li>Proposed rent data is used to populate the renewal letter to be given to the resident  </li>
<li>Residents -&gt; Residential Correspondence  </li>
<li>Renewals and small balances (less than $1000)  <ul>
<li>For small balances we don’t give them a 3 day notice to pay, we just ask them to pay as soon as possible  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create Renewal Letter, filter for lease months, generate documents -&gt; leverages proposed rent data from above.  </li>
<li>Then attach documents and show on portal and email documents (don’t like using this function because it’s not friendly, instead the team calls and emails more personably).  <ul>
<li>Also print out the renewal offers and post them on the door  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For residents that provide notice more than 75 days in advance, the team doesn’t put them on notice in Yardi, so Jason generates an offer for them and the team offers them a renewals.  </li>
<li>If anyone NSFs twice, we only let them pay in certified funds  </li>
<li>Yardi System CheckScan  </li>
<li>To scan in cashiers check  </li>
<li>People really like the checks  <ul>
<li>Particularly older residents  </li>
<li>Also allows people to avoid service fees  </li>
<li>People just come down and put checks in a box  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We accept personal checks as well  </li>
<li>Checkscan won’t let you post the batch until the calculation total is accurate  <ul>
<li>Or if you don’t print the report  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once posted, payments are posted on the resident’s portal and ledger  </li>
<li>Use Resident Payment Method report to check the residents that need to be switched from cash only back to any payment method  </li>
<li>Set residents in eviction to ‘Do not accept’ payments because we need the full amount from them including legal fees. If we accept a $ from them, their eviction is canceled.</li>

<li>Sending the residents the lease, adjusting rental options, adding occupants  </li>
<li>Adding occupants -&gt; don’t choose occupant type (demographics should be calculated)  </li>
<li>Will put parents as Roommates (considered as Leasee) if the parents are paying the rent (and sometimes don’t make 5x rent) or providing supplemental income (instead of putting guarantor - if a guarantor isn’t paying rent)  </li>
<li>Select and change units through the guest card  </li>
<li>Will do a one-time courtesy swap to change to another apartment without an application fee.  </li>
<li>Applications  </li>

<li>Challenge we have currently is the tracking and management of service contracts and compliance certificates  </li>
<li>Yardi has a platform that they’ve released but we don’t use it, we use an Excel sheet  </li>
<li>Doing it all manually  </li>
<li>Both service contracts and compliance certificates have expiration dates and we should be staying on top of their schedules.  </li>
<li>Use Yardi for phone tracking numbers within ILSs  </li>

<li>Done by the Property Controller  </li>
<li>Contract Staffing requires us working with the AP team  </li>
<li>Evelyn uses VENDORShield to vet the vendors  <ul>
<li>We have defined different classes of vendors, with different liability requirements based on risk.  </li>
<li>All managed in Yardi  </li>
<li>Sometimes takes weeks until a vendor is vetted  </li>
<li>Constantly discussing vendors with Operations and deciding how much insurance is necessary  </li>
<li>When Vendors are set up they are allocated a GL account  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once workflows are complete to approve invoices, an entry is automatically created in the ledger  </li>
<li>We only create manual entries when we need to accrue for things manually that relate to a given month (that haven’t been invoiced for yet).  </li>
<li>For utilities, Yardi accounts for tenant vs property charges in the P\&amp;L automatically  </li>
<li>Interest, taxes  </li>
<li>We use a 27.5 year amortization period -&gt; set this up in Yardi and recorded automatically  </li>

</li>
<li>There is a Yardi invoice email (one email) for all our properties that automatically assigns invoices to our properties.  </li>
<li>We have approval workflows set up in Yardi for different types of vendor  <ul>
<li>If it’s over $10,000 Eyal has to approve  </li>
<li>If a vendor asks why they weren’t paid, we can see in the workflow.  </li>

<li>Property Health Scorecard is rich in information, manifested in a way that does not appear in Yardi at all.  </li>
<li>Xuan Mai uses Yardi -   </li>
<li>People usually come to the team with a specific ask, or an ambiguous ask.  </li>
<li>For example, do we know what the average tenure of resident  </li>
<li>In asking questions about the need, they tease out usecases and potential visualizations of the data.  </li>
<li>Very familiar with the 15 or so core tables in Yardi  </li>
<li>When she gets an ask, she’ll initially write some quick Sigma to get a quick intuition into whether or not we can even answer the question and how long the solution might take.  </li>
<li>If there are explorations that are easier to do in python, she will start a Jupyter notebook to play around with how she wants to model the data and express it in python in the future.  <ul>
<li>It’s quite messy to transform a lot of the data.  </li>
<li>We are getting to a point where we have an understanding of the data model necessary to produce answers effectively.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After completing the initial exploration, she will go into the Yardi UI and into Yardi Data Model documentation (Voyager 7S Data Dictionary)  <ul>
<li>Spends a lot of time hunting in this document and hoping for the best. Some tables are well documented, others have no descriptions at all.  </li>
<li>Often need to make an educated guess on the meaning of a field. If she has to guess, she will work with the internal Yardi Team, predominantly Llu, to check.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time understanding pricing data, amenity tags, and unit statuses.   </li>
<li>Will often go into the interface and look at different units, comparing what Yardi shows to what she is seeing in the tables after doing initial exploration and engineering.  </li>
<li>Yardi does not have a master table of all of the Leases.  </li>
<li>Tenant table is either a mixed use or misnamed table or the table has evolved over time.  <ul>
<li>From the tenant table you can surmise what the most recent lease is for a given tenant.  </li>
<li>But one of the most common asks from our data stakeholders is a view into historic data.  </li>
<li>To serve this ask, because Yardi does not have a true concept of a Lease.  <ul>
<li>Lease History table is essentially an event table of all the events that may occur on a Lease. One might think that there would be a master table of all the Leases that have ever existed, but there is not. It has to be derived from the Lease History table -&gt; events that indicate a unique Lease, for which we create our own unique ID.  </li>
<li>The Lease should tell you who, where, when, etc.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lease table in Snowflake takes all the data in the tenant table, assuming it is the most recent lease for a tenant, and then fill in the historic leases and rents from the lease history table.   </li>
<li>The challenge with this is that the Lease History table is accurate from the time that we take over a lease. Therefore when we take over a building that is already occupied, we ingest data from all the current residents, but we might not ingest past resident data, leasing to an incomplete historic view of the building’s performance before we take over.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Xuan Mai feels like we have hardly scratched the surface, even if we are doing better from an analytics point of view than other multifamily companies.  </li>
<li>Only use Voyager, though will sometimes peruse RentCafe Sitemanager to see what is published on the ILSs.   </li>
<li>Spends a little time in the reports area.   </li>
<li>Occasionally uses the Unit Availability Details report to spot check our data and to understand what our stakeholders are looking at.  </li>
<li>Because Yardi has so many aspects, there is not one team member to go to about the underlying business rules around all the ways it works. For example, logic around ILS rules.  </li>
<li>Specifically, she wants to know when does a unit actually get advertised on an ILS, or how often listings are refreshed to make sure the data we are materializing is timely and accurate and to understand how numbers we see in the tables come to be.  </li>
<li>Often the biggest challenge is that we don’t have visibility into how Yardi’s system works. For instance, how they publish to the ILSs.  </li>
<li>Is Yardi accurate? Do we do testing using Yardi? To what extent?  </li>
<li>Yardi is consistent, but not necessarily accurate. There is a big difference between these two things.   </li>
<li>Assumptions that you bake into data and information need to be consistent. Because Yardi is the incumbent, it is very consistent, and so people adopt Yardi’s assumptions and believe the data to be accurate.  </li>
<li>So far the team has largely avoided financial reporting and analytics and so is not using, or planning to use the ledger suite.</li>

<li>Challenges  <ul>
<li>In Rentcafe there is a description field on the floorplans that doesn’t come back in the API  </li>
<li>The workaround is we are not showing a description  </li>
<li>When we get the list of floorplans we only get the available floorplans. If a floorplan doesn’t have availability, it doesn’t show up.  </li>
<li>There is a configuration in Rentcafe to show floorplans that are not available if we turn on the waitlist functionality.  <ul>
<li>But if we turn this on the unavailable floorplans also show up in the ILSs through syndication.  </li>

<li>Yardi is hard to use because modules have been built upon each other without any consistency or refactoring of other modules to align with the new one.   </li>
