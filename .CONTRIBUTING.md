# Contributing Workflow

## Branches
- `develop`: draft SOPs and updates
- `release`: approved SOPs (Mintlify builds from here)

## Proposing a new SOP
1. Create a brief using `agent-training/sop_brief_template.md`.
2. Draft in `develop` using `master_sop_template.md`.
3. Run Reviewer Agent (multi-persona protocol).
4. Produce:
   - `*_reviewed.md` (annotated)
   - `*_v#.1.md` (clean)
5. Open PR â†’ `release`. Include summary of changes and KPIs.

## Approvals
- Require COO or GM approval for publication.
- After merge to `release`, Mintlify auto-deploys.
